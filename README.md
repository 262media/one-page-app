one-page-app
============

A one page app boilerplate for Web or mobile using HTML5, jquery and javascript on node.js

I found a lot of great designs for single page apps, but none provided the backend functionality. This project is both,
a single page responsive UI/UX along with the backend functionality -- ready to deploy on node.js


Features
================

    - Vertical and/or horizontal scrolling page sections
    - Social media integration
    - Responsive layouts (Web and mobile) and multiple themes
    - Lightweight data store enables persistence
    - Modular functionality supports contact forms, email, user/login management
    - Easy-to-use single admin (dashboard) page to manage the entire app and content
